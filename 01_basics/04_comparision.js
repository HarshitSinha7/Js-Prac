console.log(null > 0)
console.log(null == 0)
console.log(null >= 0)// its ans is true becauseof the reason taht equality chaeck == and comparisions > > >= <= works differently
                       // Comparisions convert null to number , traeting it as 0.that's why null >= 0 is true and null > 0 is false

// ===
